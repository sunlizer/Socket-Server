# Socket Application - C#
This respitory includes c# based A multi-user chat application, in which a server must broadcast messages to all of its clients..<p>
The messages could be public or just one user.
Project purposes and data process is very similar. The differences bettween them is the one named Chat.Server is more advanced and more complicated one.
 These applications use the client-server paradigm, which is roughly
 1-One program, called the server selects a port and starts  waiting for client to connect to it.
 2- A client connects with the server port informations.
 3- Clients can send public messages or a private message for an another client to server.
 4- Server Broadcast the message.
 5- For those clients whom to send message displayed on their interface.
i hope it would be helpful.
