# Socket Application - C\#
This respitory includes c# based A multi-user chat application, in which a server must broadcast messages to all of its clients..<p>
The messages could be public or just one user.<p>
Project purposes and data process is very similar. The differences bettween them is the one named Chat.Server is more advanced and more complicated one.<p>
 These applications use the client-server paradigm, which is roughly:<p><p>
 1-One program, called the server selects a port and starts  waiting for client to connect to it.<br>
 2- A client connects with the server port informations.<br>
 3- Clients can send public messages or a private message for an another client to server.<br>
 4- Server Broadcast the message.<br>
 5- For those clients whom to send message displayed on their interface.<p>
i hope it would be helpful.<br>
